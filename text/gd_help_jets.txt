%GA %CJet Fighter%G is a fast, deadly plane capable of shooting down other
aircraft with radar-guided missiles.  When an enemy %CBomber%G invades your
territory, a %CJet Fighter%G (assuming you have one) will automatically
launch from your active defense and try to intercept it.  Sometimes the
%CBomber%G will drop a bomb before it is shot down, and sometimes the
%CBomber%G will escape the interceptor completely.

When you use a %CBomber%G, you can then fire a series of warheads on each
successive turn.  After each warhead, you can specify a target for the
%CBomber%G.  If the %CBomber%G is shot down, of course, you cannot use any
more warheads with that %CBomber%G.  Note that bombs dropped from a %CBomber%G
are released at a low altitude, preventing any ABM's from reaching
them.  A %CJet Fighter%G is the only defense against a %CBomber%G.
