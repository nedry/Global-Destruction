%GTalking to other players is very simple.  Just type what you want to
say at the prompt and press <Return>.  The message you type will be to
everyone at the table, which is handy for intimidating multiple people
at once.  If you wish to send a message to only one person, enter %W/d%G
 followed by the user's name, followed by the text. 

There are also a few actions you can do to unsuspecting players, such
as kicking, hugging, and kissing them.  You can get a list of actions
by entering "%Wactions%G" at the prompt.
