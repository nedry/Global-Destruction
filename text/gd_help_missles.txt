%GUsing a missile to carry a warhead is the most common way to set off a
nuclear explosion.  The warhead is mounted on the missile and the
missile is aimed at the offending nation.  However, there are a few
considerations to be taken.  When you wish to detonate a nuclear bomb,
you must first ready the missile with the "%Wuse%G" command.  This moves
the missile into a silo and prepares it for launch.  (Other players
will see you doing this!)  The next time your turn comes around, you
can mount a warhead on the missile.  Once the warhead is mounted, you
will be asked for the target.  You can then enter the the country name
of the victim.  Then the missile is on its way and will land on the
target player's next turn.

Missiles can only carry a warhead equal to or smaller than the
missile's rating.  The rating is a Roman numeral after the missile's
name.  For example, a %CAres IV%G can carry a %C70 mt IV%G warhead, but it
cannot carry a %C150 mt VI%G.  Only the extremely powerful %CThunderbolt VI%G
can carry that warhead.  But, the %CAres IV%G can carry a %C40 mt III%G
warhead, for example.  Generally, you want to put the biggest possible
warhead on a missile, but there are times when you might not want to,
such as testing the enemy for ABM's.
