%GAn ABM (anti-ballistic missile, or anti-missile for short) is a missile
capable of shooting down another missile.  ABM's are used for your
defense:  when an incoming missile enters your airspace, you can fire
one of your ABM's at it and destroy it (hopefully) before the warhead
detonates over your sensitive populace.  Before an ABM can be used, it
must be put your active defenses, however.  To do this, simply "%Wuse%G" the
ABM in question on your turn and it will be ready next turn.

ABM's, like missiles, are rated from I to VI in Roman numerals.  An
%CAegis VI%G ABM is the best (and rarest) ABM - it is capable of bringing
down almost any missile.  When you fire an ABM, the two levels of the
missiles are compared.  If your ABM has a higher rating, it is more
likely to bring down the missile.  Likewise, if your ABM is of a lower
rating, it is less likely.  In general, an ABM has about a 60%% chance
of bringing down a missile of the same rating.  For more information on
actually using ABM's, read "%Whelp turn%G".
