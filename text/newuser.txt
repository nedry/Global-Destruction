Welcome to the Tardis BBS.  Tardis BBS was originally brought on
line in 1985, with custom software written by the sysop at that 
time, John Lorance.  

Now the system is back, as a multi-threaded BBS.  For more information
see the [B]ulletin section.  

There is one common sense rule on this system, respect your fellow users.

The software is currently under development.  We have a working multi-line
teleconference and message boards up and running.  A QWK/REP networking 
connector is currently being written, and multi-user games are next on the 
list.  If you would like to help develop the system, please send [F]eedback
to the SYSOP.

Welcome.

Mark Firestone - sysop
