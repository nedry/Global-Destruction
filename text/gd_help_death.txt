%RDeath%G can take many forms.  In this game, however, death has only a few
forms.  %W1%G) Your country is hit with a nuclear warhead, causing your
population to reach zero.  %W2%G) A wily opponent lures the last of your
population away with persuasion and brainwashing.  %W3%GQ	) You take too long
when the game is waiting for your turn.  Surrendering, exiting the
game, and hanging up are all considered shameful forms of defeat and
are not discussed here.

When you die, all of your items are thrown away and anything that is active
is discarded, as well.  So, if you die with a %WBomber%G in the air,
then the %WBomber%G simply disappears.  However, any missiles that you
have played and loaded with warheads WILL continue to fly.  The kills from
the missile won't be attributed to you, however, since you are dead.
When a player wins the game, any missiles in the air are discarded.  So,
if you die and there is only one other player left, that player wins and
the game is over.
