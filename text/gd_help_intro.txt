%GGlobal Destruction is game about nuclear war and other seedy,
suspicious things nations do to each other.  When you play a game, you
get a country and a whole bunch of nuclear bombs, as well as some
pieces of an air force and an intelligence agency.

The environment for Global Destruction is very similar to
Teleconference.  Anything you type is sent out to everyone else at the
same table (tables are much like Teleconference channels).  You can
switch tables, whisper to users, and perform some actions as well.

The real fun begins when someone starts a nuclear war.  You start out
with a number of national resources (or "items" for short).  Among
these will be warheads, missiles, jet fighters, and all kinds of
complicated things that are just about to be explained.  In the
meantime, remember that you can enter "%Wstock%G" at any time in
the game to see what you have available.  (By the way, the command to
start a war is "%Wstart%G"!)

The most common items are in three groups: missiles, warheads, and
ABM's.  ABM is short for anti-ballistic missile, or anti-missile.  More
on ABM's later.  Each of these kind of items has a rating, which is a
Roman numeral from I to VI after the name of the item.  The higher the
rating, the better the item.  If you want to launch a missile, one of
the most common activities in this game, you use a missile item.  To
use an item (any item!), enter "use" followed by the item's name in your
stockpile.  Let's say you have a %CTrident III%G you want to fire at the poor
computer players.  When your turn comes around, you enter "%Wuse tri%G".
You can enter abbreviations as short as you like when using a resource.
Once you do that, your turn is over and the %CTrident III%G is loaded into a
silo, ready to fire.

Your turn comes back around after everyone else plays and the game
tells you that your %CTrident III%G is standing by for a warhead.  Good,
because you want to blow someone up!  If you forgot what warheads you
have, you could enter "%Wstock%G" here to see what you have.  Assume for the
example that you have a %C100 mt V%G and a %C40 mt III%G.  Now, a %C100 mt V%G is a
good warhead: 100 megatons of nuclear power.  But, if you try to play
it now, the game won't let you.  Why?  Because that %CTrident III%G can't
carry such a big warhead.  Remember, it's a %CTrident III%G, not a %CTrident V%G!
You need a missile of rating V to carry that warhead.

So, you decide to use the %C40 mt III%G, since that's the biggest one you
can put on the missile.  You type "%Wuse 40%G" and then you are prompted
for a target.  If you didn't already have one in mind, then enter
"%Wtable%G" at the target prompt.  Once you choose your target, enter the
name of the victim.  Assuming you still want to pick on the computer
players, you could enter "%WLibya%G" to bother Moammar Khadafy.

The missile is in the air now - either it's going to explode over his
country or he's going to intercept it.  This is where ABM's come in.
When you use an ABM, it moves into a special area called your active
defense arsenal.  Once an ABM is in this area, it can be used to
intercept an incoming missile.  Assume you are Moammar Khadafy.  When
you saw this player load the %CTrident III%G into a silo, you got nervous
and used your %CPatriot III%G, which is an ABM.

Now that %CTrident III%G is headed for you and you have to do something
about it!  You can type "%Wincoming%G" to fire off ABM's at incoming
missiles.  However, you CAN'T use an ABM this turn and use it for
incoming missiles.  You have to have the ABM already ready when the
missile starts coming in.  It's not all bad news, though!  Firing an
ABM doesn't take up your turn.  You can still use another item normally.

The rating of the ABM comes in to play here: ABM's will usually
intercept a missile of the same rating.  If you use a higher rating ABM
on a smaller missile, then it is more likely to work.  By the same token,
a %CLiberator I%G is not very likely to bring down an incoming %CAres IV%G!

Here's something to note: the rating of the ABM applies to the missile,
not the warhead.  If someone were to fire a %CThunderbolt VI%G with a puny
%C20 mt II%G warhead, your %CGuardian II%G wouldn't do very well against it.
In that case, you might not even want to use a big ABM - the warhead is
so small, you'd be better off saving the ABM for a %CThunderbolt VI%G with a
bigger bomb.  Then again, if you only have 2 million population left...

Speaking of population, that is the meter of how well your country is
doing.  The more population you have, the longer you will live.  When
your population reaches zero, your country collapses and you are out of
the game.  Needless to say, nuclear bombs detonating over your country
will cause you to lose population!  Enter "%Wstat%G" to see your
population at any time.  This also shows any ready missiles.

There are plenty of other types of items in the game, such as the
persuasion devices, bombers, spies, and immigration plans.  You can get
help for any item in your stockpile by entering "help", followed by the item's
name.  So, if you had this mysterious %CMisinformation%G item handy, enter
"%Whelp misinf%G" for detail on it.

Before you start a game, make sure you check out a couple of the help
files in the game.  An important one to check out is "%Whelp tables%G"
inside the game.  You can go off to a vacant table to check out the
files if you don't want to be disturbed by a game in progress.  Just
entering "%Whelp%G" by itself in the game gives you a list of topics.
Eventually, you'll probably want to read them all, but you can wait
until the appropriate moment in the game.  Until then, make sure you
check out "%Whelp commands%G", also.
